Unfortunately, Tenchu San Portable was never localized for the English-speaking market, so many fans of the series have been unable to enjoy this game. However, there is a way to play Tenchu San Portable in English on your PSP or PS Vita, thanks to some dedicated fans who have created an English patch for the game.
  
In this article, we will show you how to download and install the Tenchu San Portable English patch on your PSP or PS Vita, and how to use thumbsticks for camera controls instead of the D-pad. Follow these steps and you will be able to experience Tenchu San Portable in English on your handheld device.
  
## Step 1: Download the Tenchu San Portable ISO file
  
The first thing you need to do is to download the Tenchu San Portable ISO file from a reliable source. You can find it on various websites that offer PSP ROMs, such as freeroms.com[^1^]. Make sure you download the Japanese version of the game, as the English patch will not work on any other version.
  
## Step 2: Download the Tenchu San Portable English patch
  
The next thing you need to do is to download the Tenchu San Portable English patch from one of these links: [^2^] or [^3^]. The patch was created by a YouTube user named Irfan.H, who also made a video tutorial on how to apply it. The patch includes English subtitles, menus, and narration for the game. It also changes some of the voice actors to match the ones from Tenchu: Return from Darkness, which was an enhanced version of Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven for the Xbox.
  
## Step 3: Extract the files from the patch
  
After you download the Tenchu San Portable English patch, you need to extract the files from it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should get a folder named "TEXTURES" that contains several files with .ini and .png extensions. These are the files that will replace the original Japanese ones in the game.
  
## Step 4: Copy the files to your PSP or PS Vita
  
Now you need to copy the files from the "TEXTURES" folder to your PSP or PS Vita. If you are using a PSP, you need to connect it to your computer via USB cable and enable USB mode. Then you need to open the folder named "PSP" on your PSP's memory stick and create a new folder named "TEXTURES" inside it. Then you need to copy all the files from the "TEXTURES" folder on your computer to the "TEXTURES" folder on your PSP.
  
If you are using a PS Vita, you need to have a hacked device with custom firmware and a plugin called Adrenaline that allows you to run PSP games on your PS Vita. You also need a program called VitaShell that allows you to access your PS Vita's file system. Then you need to launch Adrenaline and press SELECT to open the Adrenaline menu. Then you need to go to Settings > Advanced > Memory Stick Location and change it to uma0:pspemu (if you are using an SD2Vita adapter) or ux0:pspemu (if you are using a Sony memory card). Then you need to exit Adrenaline and launch VitaShell. Then you need to navigate to uma0:pspemu/PSP or ux0:pspemu/PSP (depending on your memory stick location) and create a new folder named "TEXTURES" inside it. Then you need to copy all the files from the "TEXTURES" folder on your computer to the "TEXTURES" folder on your PS Vita.
